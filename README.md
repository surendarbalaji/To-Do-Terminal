# To-Do-Terminal
This is a basic scala project that allows the user to create, check off, view and delete their own tasks within the terminal.

It was made primarily during my one week of Y12 Work Experience at Santander, where scala was the language used for data analysis.

Obviously, I didn't get a company login, so aside from meetings and shadowing I was free to do as I pleased and so I familiarised myself with the language and decided to build this project.
